# BUG-666: Missing Transaction Filter

## Description

The "Recent Transactions" table on the main dashboard is missing a feature. Users are unable to filter the list of transactions by their type (i.e., 'credit' or 'debit').

## Acceptance Criteria

- A dropdown or similar UI control should be added to the transaction list.
- The user should be able to select 'All', 'Credit', or 'Debit' from the filter.
- The transaction list should update to show only the transactions of the selected type.
